/**
 * Robinhood Chain network definition.
 *
 * Chain ID 4663 and the RPC URL below were probed live from this machine on
 * 2026-09-02: `eth_chainId` returned `0x1237` (4663) and `eth_blockNumber`
 * answered, so the endpoint is real and reachable. The explorer URL is
 * best-effort from public third-party sources and has NOT been confirmed
 * against docs.robinhood.com/chain — re-verify before pointing any of this
 * at real funds.
 *
 * Robinhood Chain reportedly has no native gas token: gas is paid in ETH,
 * and there is no official Robinhood Chain airdrop token. Treat anything
 * claiming otherwise as suspicious.
 *
 * Every value is overridable by env so a corrected endpoint never needs a
 * code change.
